#  Barcode Detector

Scan barcodes with a camera, or generate your own using the following supported types:
- [QR Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code)
- [Code 128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_128)
- [PDF417](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF417)
- [Aztec Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Code)

I'm interested in adding more barcode types, such as EAN-13, CODE-39/93, UPC, etc. but it's not on the top of my to-do list
